# ClinicalML — AI Drug & Diet Recommendation System

ClinicalML is an interactive, browser-native web application that simulates a two-stage machine learning pipeline for clinical trial enhancement and personalized patient care. 

In Stage 1, the system uses an ensemble of **real machine learning models** trained on over 100,000 patient records to predict one of seven disease classifications. In Stage 2, it acts as a recommendation engine to suggest personalized, clinically-focused diet and pharmacological interventions.

## 🌟 Key Features

*   **Zero-Dependency Browser Inference Engine:** Inference runs entirely locally via pure JavaScript (`js/ml-models.js`). The system executes pre-trained Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (DNN) mathematical models natively without any external backend servers or ONNX runtimes.
*   **Trained on Real Data:** Powered by `104,909` combined clinical records (Diabetes Prediction and Stroke Prediction public datasets).
*   **7-Class Disease Prediction:** Models are trained to differentiate and predict across 7 distinct clinical states:
    1. Type 2 Diabetes
    2. Hypertension
    3. Cardiovascular Disease (CVD)
    4. Stroke
    5. Metabolic Syndrome
    6. Obesity-related Disorder
    7. Healthy (Control)
*   **Dual Recommendation Engine:** Translates Stage 1 disease classifications and patient vitals into actionable, confidence-rated Diet and Drug schedules based on rule-based clinical guidelines.
*   **Data-Driven Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The UI presents dynamic Radar charts, interactive Feature Importance graphs, and Correlation Heatmaps computed directly from the real-world statistical distribution of the training data.

## 🚀 How to Run the Application

Because ClinicalML uses lightweight JSON representations of models, you do not need an active Python backend. You only need a basic static HTTP server to host the HTML/JS.

1.  Navigate into the project directory.
2.  Start a static server. You can use npx, Python, or Live Server:
    *   **Node.js:** `npx serve . --listen 3030`
    *   **Python:** `python -m http.server 3030`
3.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3030`.

## 🧠 Retraining the Machine Learning Models

If you wish to augment the initial data or modify the model architecture, you can retrain the models:

1. Ensure you have the raw CSV clinical data in the root directory:
   - `diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv`
   - `healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv`
2. Navigate to the `training` directory and install the requirements:
   ```bash
   cd training
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train_models.py
   ```
   *The script will automatically parse the data, handle class balancing, train the models, compute feature statistics, and overwrite the JSON models in `/models` and `/js/data_computed.js`.*

## 💻 Tech Stack
